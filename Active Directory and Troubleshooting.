Active Directory Home Lab
Project Overview
I designed and deployed a virtualized home lab environment to gain hands-on experience with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and security auditing. This lab mirrors enterprise environments where I practiced user management, security group nesting, and Group Policy enforcement.

Technical Environment
Hypervisor: VirtualBox / VMware

Domain Controller: Windows Server 2022 (Standard Evaluation)

Client Endpoint: Windows 10/11 Enterprise

Network: Isolated NAT Network for secure testing

Key Configurations Completed
Forest/Domain Setup: Promoted a Windows Server to a Domain Controller and configured a private DNS zone. * User Administration: Created Organizational Units (OUs) for different departments and utilized the Principle of Least Privilege to assign permissions.

Group Policy Objects (GPOs): > * Enforced password complexity requirements.

Disabled CMD/PowerShell for non-admin users.

Configured Audit Policies to log successful and failed login attempts (Event ID 4624/4625). * Network Troubleshooting: Resolved connectivity issues between the client and DC, ensuring proper DNS resolution and IP configuration.

Security Monitoring
I utilized this lab to study brute-force attack patterns by analyzing event logs, which directly supports my CompTIA CySA+ training and WGU Digital Forensics (D829) coursework.
